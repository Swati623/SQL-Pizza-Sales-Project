The dataset consists of four interrelated tables:
1)Pizzas: Contains information about pizza sizes and prices.
2)Pizza Types: Details the pizza names,categories and their ingredients.
3)Orders: Captures order-level information like order ID and date and time.
4)Order Details: Provides itemized details of each order, including quantities .
Project Highlights:
Total of 13 SQL queries:
5 Basic Queries: For initial exploration of the data.
5 Intermediate Queries: To analyze trends and summarize data.
3 Advanced Queries: For complex calculations and insights.
Future Scope:
Visualize the insights using Power BI or Tableau.
